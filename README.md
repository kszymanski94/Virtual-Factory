Virtual Factory Simulation in Unreal Engine 5

Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive and realistic virtual factory simulation using Unreal Engine 5. It integrates key aspects of Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT), including industrial protocols, cybersecurity components, and visualization tools.

### Objectives

    - Develop a detailed virtual factory concept.

    - Implement realistic industrial communication protocols.

    - Build a fully functional virtual environment representing a real-world industrial setup.

    - Integrate security solutions such as Firewall, IDS, SIEM, and historical data management (Historian).

    - Include realistic Human-Machine Interface (HMI) visualizations.

### 1. Concept Development and Industrial Protocols Selection

    - Define the virtual factory layout, machinery, processes, and workflows.

    - Select appropriate industrial communication protocols, such as:

    - OPC UA

Modbus TCP/IP

PROFINET

EtherNet/IP

Justify protocol selection based on reliability, real-time performance, and cybersecurity.

### 2. Functional Virtual Factory Environment

Create detailed 3D models of machinery, workstations, conveyor systems, and production lines.

Develop interactive environments for simulation and training purposes.

Implement physics-based interactions and animations for realism.

Simulate typical operational scenarios including normal operations, maintenance, and emergency shutdowns.

### 3. Industrial Protocols Communication

Program communication channels between simulated PLCs and SCADA systems using selected industrial protocols.

Implement C++ plugins to handle real-time data exchange and process control.

Validate the accuracy and efficiency of protocol communication through simulated data traffic and performance metrics.

### 4. Integration with Existing IT/OT Solutions

Simulate the IT environment, including servers, networking equipment, and cybersecurity tools.

Implement and configure cybersecurity elements:

Firewall (e.g., Palo Alto or Fortinet virtual appliances)

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems

Establish realistic OT environment components:

Database historians for data logging and analytics

Realistic Human-Machine Interface (HMI) visualizations for operator training

### Usage

Suitable for cybersecurity training, industrial protocol analysis, and operational scenario simulations.

Beneficial for training IT/OT security teams, operators, engineers, and students.
