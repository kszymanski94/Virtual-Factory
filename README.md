Virtual Factory Simulation in Unreal Engine 5

Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive and realistic virtual factory simulation using Unreal Engine 5. It integrates key aspects of Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT), including industrial protocols, cybersecurity components, and visualization tools.

Objectives

📌 Develop a detailed virtual factory concept.

🔗 Implement realistic industrial communication protocols.

🏭 Build a fully functional virtual environment representing a real-world industrial setup.

🔒 Integrate security solutions such as Firewall, IDS, SIEM, and historical data management (Historian).

🎛️ Include realistic Human-Machine Interface (HMI) visualizations.

📌 1. Concept Development and Industrial Protocols Selection

Define the virtual factory layout, machinery, processes, and workflows.

Select appropriate industrial communication protocols, such as:

🔹 OPC UA

🔹 Modbus TCP/IP

🔹 PROFINET

🔹 EtherNet/IP

Justify protocol selection based on reliability, real-time performance, and cybersecurity.

🏗️ 2. Functional Virtual Factory Environment

🏭 Create detailed 3D models of machinery, workstations, conveyor systems, and production lines.

🕹️ Develop interactive environments for simulation and training purposes.

🎬 Implement physics-based interactions and animations for realism.

🚨 Simulate typical operational scenarios including normal operations, maintenance, and emergency shutdowns.

🔗 3. Industrial Protocols Communication

📡 Program communication channels between simulated PLCs and SCADA systems using selected industrial protocols.

🖥️ Implement C++ plugins to handle real-time data exchange and process control.

📊 Validate the accuracy and efficiency of protocol communication through simulated data traffic and performance metrics.

🔒 4. Integration with Existing IT/OT Solutions

🖧 Simulate the IT environment, including servers, networking equipment, and cybersecurity tools.

🔥 Implement and configure cybersecurity elements:

🛡️ Firewall (e.g., Palo Alto or Fortinet virtual appliances)

🕵️ Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

📈 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems

🏭 Establish realistic OT environment components:

🗄️ Database historians for data logging and analytics

🎛️ Realistic Human-Machine Interface (HMI) visualizations for operator training
